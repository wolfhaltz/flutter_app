So, let's update:<br>
I'm doing the NLW#5, in Flutter path, and doing the tutorial. It's a kind of DevQuiz, and I think that is a good idea to code,
mainly because I have that useless and empty repo called "NeuroQuiz".<br>
Well, now it will have a function hahahaha. Probably I'll do the app here and the website there :)
